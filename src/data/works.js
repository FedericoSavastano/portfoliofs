        "Taskly is a fullstack task management app built with the MERN stack. It allows users to create projects, assign roles, manage tasks with status updates, and add notes. Developed with React + TypeScript on the frontend and Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (Mongoose) with TypeScript on the backend.",

      fullDescription: `
      <p>Taskly is a fullstack project management application inspired by tools like Trello, designed to streamline team collaboration and task organization.

The platform provides user authentication and account creation, ensuring secure access to projects. </p>
<p>Once logged in, users can: </p>

<ul>
<li>Create and manage projects</li>

<li>Assign roles and tasks to team members</li>

<li>Track task progress by updating their status</li>

<li>Add notes and comments directly to tasks for better context and communication</li>

</ul>

<p>fFrom a technical perspective, the frontend was built with React and TypeScript, delivering a responsive and type-safe user experience. The backend was developed using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (Mongoose) with TypeScript, enabling scalable data management and a robust API layer.

This project demonstrates not only technical proficiency in the MERN stack with TypeScript but also the ability to design and implement real-world features for collaborative productivity tools.</p>
